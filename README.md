# VS Code Configuration
This repo contains my current settings and configuration for Visual Studio Code.

## Settings
All the settings I have changed are present in the `settings.json` file. These include native VS Code settings as well as settings for the extensions I have installed.

## Extensions
I use several extensions to boost productivity and improve aesthetics. A list of all these extensions (with links) is present inside `Extensions.md`.

## Images
I use a VS Code extension to change the background image of the editor (the background changes every 5 minutes). All background images I use are in the `backgrounds` folder.
These images were taken from [this](https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/50-minimalist-desktop-wallpapers-and-backgrounds/) website.
